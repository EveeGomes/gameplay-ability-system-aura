   * Add the Mapping Context.
   * The IMC, AuraContext, will be set in BP. So we need to check in case this pointer isn't set for some reason, which makes it invalid!
   *  That could cause some issues like the input not working, which is enough for stopping execution. Well, that's a great reason for setting
   *  the IMC on the player controller! Also, the game shouldn't continue if input isn't working, and for that we can use an assert!
   * So we'll use the check macro and send the IMC ptr. That will halt execution in case the condition fails: if the ptr hasn't been set yet,
   *  it'll be evaluated as false! This way we assert that aura context is set and if trying to run the game without setting it, we'll get a crash.
